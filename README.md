# Dataset for Perez et al., (2021) 

Dataset containing the Peak flow values generated from the RainyDay-HLM framework for the 
Turkey River and Cedar River Watersheds.  
Each watershed rotation contains 10,000 peak flows (20 realizations of 500 rainfall-runoff events)

Q_Rot_HLM_Turkey.mat: Results for Turkey River watershed and 4 sub-watersheds

Q_Rot_HLM_Cedar.mat: Results for Cedar River watershed

Each column represent a rotation from 0° to 330° in steps of 30°, and each row is a rainfall-runoff event.
